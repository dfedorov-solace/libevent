This is a branch made from the "patches-1.4" branch of libevent.

I needed to build 64-bit binaries of libevent version 1.4.X 
on Windows 7 with Visual Studio 2015, so here it is.

The regress project still doesn't build and if I can avoid fixing it, I will.

This branch was not verified on any other platforms and it won't.

Keep your stick on the ice!
